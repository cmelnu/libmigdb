* Fixed: directory in compressed sources.

Revision 1.1  2004/07/20 20:38:42  set
* Added: C++ wrapper to attach to a running process. Also modified the low
level function to return the current frame.
* Modified: Now if we get an error while the state is running we assume the
previous "running" was wrong and we are in fact stopped. Until now I saw
two cases where gdb says we are running and then shows an error.
